	<p>Honestly, Yes and No. Curry has the best shot in the NBA and arugably history. No because he is the best offensive scorer our era has seen after guys like Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, and Kareem. And in fact, the first unanimous MVP even though critics say some players should’ve had that title before Curry although I won’t get deeper into that. Top it off with 400 three pointers last season is already crazy. Curry leads the league in made and attempted three-pointers, which is even more impressive considering he’s shooting 42.2 percent from beyond the arc. He ranks sixth in assists per game and first in steals per game.</p>

	<p>And yes, he is overrated, because he was the best offensive scorer only in the regular season. Deeper in the playoffs he was not performing the way he should perform unlike the first 82 games (or in other words, ‘choking’). A player’s performance in the playoffs, I think, is more significant than in the regular season.</p>

	<p> One thing that cannot be argued, whether your the Curry Fan or not, is that Curry is the Highest Paid NBA Player in history due the number he has put up in the last 4 seasons. Curry new contract extension, goes for a record setting 5 Year/201 Million dollars. Let that sink in.</p>
